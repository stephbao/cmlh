,R_2wz4YRvmbL5UTCq,4,2,3,The manager reviewed the analysis.,1,0,6,It's fair to let a system help make the best decision.,4,4,4,4,4,4,It's hard to tell how Chris would feel in the situation.,6,Sounds look a guy that wants the best out of a situation.,3,33,2,2,1,Rules followed by calculations on a set of properties.
,R_2ysdPboRx9zoiMd,4,3,3,The manager monitored the algorithm,0,0,3,I don't feel computers can monitor emotions or tone of voice,4,2,2,6,6,6,That is how I would feel if I was in Chris's position,2,Pretty much the same answer I gave above. I wouldn't want a computer trying to evaluate me.,1,46,1,2,5,I think it is a computer but I am not certain
,R_2qfmFP9PTiASY9t,4,4,3,The manager would work together with the results that the algorithm produced based on the customer's comments to evaluate Chris' performance.,1,0,5,"The evaluation is mostly automated in that it will be fair to all people, but is not an actual depiction of his performance.",5,6,4,2,3,5,I think Chris will be generally happy about his evaluation because he was not cheated.,3,The algorithm might be very good but it is not perfect in analyzing all of human interaction.,1,25,2,5,1,Algorithms are like formulas that computers use to take a lot of data into account and come up with a designated response.
,R_3lJHFgGUNNPLYdv,4,4,3,"The manager judged the employee, while the algorithm analyzed the customer data. ",1,0,3,"The algorithm may not be able to catch the nuances of human interaction. For example, can it detect sarcasm?",3,2,4,5,5,7,"If the algorithm is flawed, then Chris will be judged unfairly, and that will cause him to feel frustrated and angry.",2,I spent the early part of my career working with algorithms. They were flawed more often than not.,3,37,1,4,1,"Algorithms are formulas created to perform a specific function (in this case, analyzing data sets)."
,R_22JrV4NcNkcwPZc,4,3,1,0,1,0,4,When you get employed usually you have to follow rules and do they you dont necessarily like. But IMO I don't think people should be monitored unless they had prior issues.,2,1,1,5,5,5,This is how I would feel and I didnt see anything explaining how he feels in the survey.,2,"Don't how the algorithm is made, what it judges, and IMO you cant make a program to judge how person is feeling",2,37,2,4,1,computer programs like how Google gets its search results
,R_3qIPEfnIt4Bml8D,4,4,3,The manager and algorithm would both be used to evaluate an employees call center work performance.,1,0,3,"I think algorithms have a long way to go in terms of accuracy. For this reason, I would not use it at all.",3,2,1,4,1,5,I think he would think it's an unfair practice.,1,I really do not think it measures accurately.,1,37,2,5,1,I think they are computer calculations that are used by computers to make decisions.
,R_4ZysHdiVSsD1xZv,4,4,3,"The manager analyzed his past call recording, and the algorithm checked his customer comments.",1,0,6,The algorithm may catch things that his manager may miss and vice versa.,5,4,5,2,3,2,"I think if Chris did a good job, he would want more scrutiny to show that is the case.",6,"I think it's helpful to have the algorithm be involved, but also have the human touch as well, as some nuanced things can't be detected by algorithms",1,35,2,2,1,I think they are a process of or set of rules that a computer follows to offer solutions to problems.
,R_2SJPe1nbJb2tRze,4,3,3,The manager would take the data presented by the algorithm and interpret it and make his decisions based on that. ,0,0,2,I think it would be difficult for a non-human entity to be able to discern tone and intent. I think it requires intelligence and critical thinking skill. ,3,3,4,5,5,6,I think it could be frustrating and humiliating to realize that your job performace is being judged based on intel from a non-intelligent entity.,1,"I don't trust ""algorithms"". What ever happened to real human interaction?",1,48,1,2,1,A process or series of steps involved in computerising results. 
,R_1hzLAAUTUv3fGSX,4,3,3,Manager monitored the algorithm. ,0,0,3,Too many variables in customer service to fairly rate performance with an algorithm.,4,2,2,5,4,5,Chris would know that an algorithm does not take in account enough things to properly evaluate his performance and probably would not like it.,2,Does not take into account the type of customers Chris had to deal with.,1,59,2,3,1,Data that is inputted into a computer and calculated by a certain set of rules to predict an outcome.
,R_2WwpNgMJCL7S65h,4,3,3,the manager oversaw the algorithm,0,0,6,Honestly I can't see why It wouldn't be fair,5,5,5,2,2,2,why would he be negative?,6,It was designed with good intentions,1,75,1,5,1,a set of responses to a situation
,R_1eE12yPSUR21TRl,4,2,3,The manager would read over the algorithm reports then make his judgment based on that. ,1,0,3,I think it would be more fair if the manager actually listened in rather than relying on computer software.,2,2,2,4,5,5,He might feel it isn't a fair way to actually judge his performance. ,2,"I don't trust computer software to always know the truth about human beings, how they act and react, and perform. ",1,51,1,4,1,"It's software that gathers data from something/someone over a period of time and compares it with what the ""norm"" is. "
,R_3pgSSLnPgmHMHDN,4,2,3,"The algorithm evaluated the tone of voice and customer comments during calls, the manager then looks at the results and evaluates the employee based on that.",1,0,3,I think a system like this could lead to mistakes and unfair judgements.,4,4,4,5,5,5,He might be worried if he's getting an accurate evaluation or not.,3,I'm not sure if the manager could make a sound judgment if the algorithm has errors.,1,27,1,3,1,They're computer processes that follow a set a rules in problem solving.
,R_3MlinaWfzwr4esk,4,2,5,0,1,1,6,follow process and procedures.,7,6,6,1,1,1,"Manager has evaluate his job performance, this is part of there procedures.",7,It's a good method performance check of employee.,2,62,2,3,2,Rules and regulations for performance.
,R_2zScUlwx98NQi1l,4,4,3,The manager also reviewed the conversations but the algorithm ultimately had the final say.,1,0,5,It is the company policy that is being adhered to but it leaves a subjective thing in the hands of a machine.,3,4,3,5,4,5,It may not understand the nuances of conversation leaving him feeling bad.,3,It may not understand the nuances of conversation.,2,29,2,5,1,The process and method by which a complicated task is done.
,R_1kFw40S3R1bwSNf,4,4,3,they worked together to make a determination on how the customer service agent performed,1,0,5,it is somewhat fair as long as the manager is able to have a say and it is not based on the algorithm alone,5,5,6,2,3,3,Chris will be happy as long as he is fairly evaluated ,5,algorithms can be wrong at times so I do not fully trust it,1,52,1,5,1,algorthims are ways to evaluate someone based on certain data and how they perform overall
,R_1rfbSVCVoThRyJj,4,2,3,they checked tone and calls,1,0,1,"Most customers don't have the time to deal with customer service so their side could always be short, and that doesn't mean that Chris is bad at his job, it means others are impatient",2,2,2,6,6,6,He probably would know that he was being judged unfairly,3,maybe he knows what he's doing,1,36,1,3,1,"I think it is the things be checked by use of a computer instead of a human, by a human"
,R_2bNW5tBuvMDNO60,4,2,3,Data was collected by the algorithm and then the manager makes the final decision.,1,0,5,If that is standardized practice then that is fair.,4,4,4,4,4,4,Depending on the result perhaps Chris will feel good or perhaps not.,4,I think the feedback will be good data but that some human evaluation is needed also.,2,31,1,4,1,Probably done by customer keyword during interaction over a specified timeframe.
