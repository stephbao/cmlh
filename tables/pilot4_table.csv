So if Chris is available in the morning when there is work to be done, it's very fair for his shifts to be scheduled then.",7,6,4,1,1,1,"Chris will probably be happy to get a shift when he is available so that he doesn't have scheduling conflicts and he knows he'll be busy during his shift, not sitting around bored waiting for customers.",6,"The algorithm monitors the amount of customers which is probably better done by a computer than just people guessing based on how busy it felt. Then it also has a human touch of the manager inputting details about when employees are actually available, based on what they've told him. So the scheduling should take both of these into consideration and come up with some good results.",1,34,1,8,1,"Algorithms receive data and information and break it down with calculations to find a pattern or a solution to a problem (in this case, when to schedule workers)."
