My inclination is that it is probably fair since it's fairly objective rather than subjective.",3,3,3,5,5,5,"Chris would probably be upset in particular situations where the algorithm was unable to accurately assess the situation due to lack of knowledge about the context, eg maybe somebody was hard of hearing and he had to speak up.",3,The failing would probably be that the manager might be inclined to rely on the algorithm without making their own judgments about the situation.,3,36,2,5,1,A set of rules devised to analyze input data and formulate output.

",4,4,4,2,2,2,If Chris was doing an adequate job why should he have any feelings about it. ,6,I think that this type of analysis would be very fair because it would not be bias. ,1,49,1,3,1,I think they are markers that employees must meet to be considered successful employees. 
,R_1n2f1JNmmoJePjX,4,4,3,The algorithm was based on his analyses,It used the manager's analyses to evaluate the performance of customer service,1.0,0.0,6,"I think it's fair to use, since the algorithm also incorporates the manager's analyses and not just a computer program.",6,5,5,2,2,2,I think he would be fine with it because it uses his manager and the algorithm. It's a fair assessment.,6,I think I would trust it since it uses a manager's influence in its calculations and the manager knows best,1,33,1,5,1,They are written computer programs.

Also, the manager is not evaluating Chris using is own observations. ",3,2,3,5,2,4,I think that Chris would feel that he would want his manager's opinion of his work performance. Taking the analysis of an algorithm denies him that. ,2,"The algorithm will only tell the manager what it is calculated to report. If the algorithm is not set up correctly, it could lead to poor decisions. ",1,36,1,5,2,Algorithms are formulas used to calculate a desired result.

,R_9zBcoiC7OtWI8eJ,4,4,3,Human manager's role was to evaluate past customer service calls,Algorithm's role was to use customer comments and compare,1.0,0.0,4,"The system is using both review systems to evaluate the employee which helps with accuracy, performance and ensures that the company is getting quality work.",5,5,5,1,1,1,In the scenario above it does not say that anything negative game from the review of Chris and his work performance so I wouldn't think that he would have any negative feelings at this point unless there are things that weren't mentioned in the scenario that he may be worried about.,6,I would say that I would trust until there is reason to feel otherwise. Using the algorithm to evaluate an employee will help ensure that they have quality work and that their workers are producing high end work and is worth paying for,1,31,1,3,1,I would say that it is a set of rules that expected to be followed
