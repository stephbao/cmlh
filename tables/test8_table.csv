Is the caller already mad or happy before the interaciton with chris. Things can happen before the call which Chri's doesn't know about.,5,If they use an algorithm to evaluate then it must have had good experience.,1,27,2,4,4,Just a formula for certain things that happens.

These can be number based or in this case based on vocals and tones coming from your mouth.  Similar to a lie detector test I suppose.

Agreements aside, I do not think that electronics monitoring and evaluating something as subjective as tone especially out of context, is a fair way to evaluate the performance of a human.",4,4,4,4,4,4,His feelings would reflect his evaluation. I do not know how he was evaluated/the results of his evaluation so he could be feeling any number of ways.,2,"There is context that has to be considered when taking tone into account. Some dialects are rougher than others, that doesn't mean that the speaker is angry or otherside perturbed. Some people can mask their frustrations very well and not ""sound"" angry at all.",1,30,1,4,1,Calculations or rules that a computer uses in calculations or problem-solving tasks.

The algorithm is computer based and does not have any feelings toward the employee thus taking some of the subjectivity out of the process.  So if the computer evals are very different than the manager's, that could be viewed as a type of audit.  It is a good thing in the long run",4,4,3,5,2,4,People tend to trust people over algorithms so I would think Chris's view on the algorithm would be somewhat distrustful.  So his views on the algorithm would be on the low side.,6,"I work in IT and I've used algorithms before so I know they are unbiased and fair.

That is why I put neither agree nor disagree. However, I disagree on the ones which don't make sense to me. I believe that he was aware of this review and had no reason to be angry nor proud.",4,The algorithm could possibly work very well. I really have no way of knowing.,3,56,1,5,1,It's a series of instructions which analyze something and tell the computer the answer.
