2.8333333333333335,R_3OjHCCr7yYHYVcY,4,4,3,"The manager and the algorithm both analyze the performance of Chris, the employee. He is then given a performance evaluation based on both the manager's opinion and the algorithm's analysis.",1.0,0.0,5,I think the algorithm portion of the analysis is fair because you can learn what metrics the algorithm uses and improve on those areas so that you get a higher score. I think that the manager's analysis is too subjective and can be unfair in some instances.,3,3,4,6,5,6,I think Chris would not like that his manager's analysis of his performance is subjective and based on opinion.,4,I don't trust the manager's analysis very much. I trust the algorithm much more.,1,25,2,5,3,"Algorithms are sets of formulas with many variables. When the variables are all put in, the algorithm is used to calculate a certain metric."

5.5,R_1FlK3KHOpem2Ils,4,3,3,the algorithm analyzes the customers tones and comments and evaluates how the worker is handling the call.  The manager oversees it to make sure it's going well. ,0.0,0.0,4,The employer has the right to make up their rules,5,5,5,2,2,2,"He might rather trust in an algorithm than a manager, who could be biased. ",6,I assume that it works properly. ,2,40,2,3,1,They are programs that are set up to run and solve problems or make evaluations based on various rules. 
3.0,R_8ljqyy5n7m5RnEt,4,2,3,the manager uses the algorithm to evaluate his employees.,1.0,0.0,5,I think it is more important that chris cares for his customers.,3,3,3,5,5,5,i would think that chris thinks that he is more than a series of evaluations made by a computer.,2,I think that there is a human elemnet the algorithm can't account for.,1,44,1,3,1,I think it is a series of markers evaluated by a computer program
3.6666666666666665,R_wN8OZlrY5o5J74l,4,3,3,The algorithm graded Chris's phone calls based on tone and customer interaction. The manager monitors and adjusts the program based on what they feel.,0.0,0.0,5,"Its part of Chris's company's choice on how they monitor customer relations, I think it is fair.",4,2,4,4,4,4,No one likes being reviewed.,4,"Its all about how the manager adjusts the algorithm, based on the scenario text. So if the manager does his job and Chris does his job he should have nothing to worry about.",3,29,2,4,1,A set of instructions that will complete a task.
3.3333333333333335,R_1DwhwhG4mmTANvi,4,4,3,The manager analyzes the calls and the algorithm analyzes the comments then the algorithm comes up with the final evaluation.,1.0,0.0,5,It depends on how good the algorithm is.,3,3,4,4,5,5,He might want someone real to analyze the comments.,3,I would need more info on the algorithm. ,1,32,2,5,1,A program that automatically goes through info.
2.8333333333333335,R_1LzFjVoJ9jBxjNa,4,4,3,Manager uses algorthm to replace their time to evaluate employees.,1.0,0.0,2,The algorithm can not accuratly evaluate and subject to mistakes.,2,2,2,2,5,6,Chris would be upset that a machine plays a large role in evaluating performance because of distrust.,2,The algo will make mistakes with bad programming that doesn't account for human factors.,1,37,2,2,1,The are just programs that are automated to do specific functions.
3.0,R_1kGIIIdOFrqjhBt,4,2,3,The manager made an overall evaluation based on the results of the algorithm.,1.0,0.0,3,I don't think an algorithm could accurately evaluate an audio recording.,3,3,3,5,5,5,Chris probably feels there are certain aspects of human interaction that a computer program simply can't evaluate.,2,An employee evaluation should be conducted on a case-by-case basis.,1,35,2,4,1,A set of rules for programs.
5.666666666666667,R_21hw47H5Qe0w7EC,4,3,3,The manager watched over the algorithm and set perimeters to how he wanted the algorithm to review the employees. ,0.0,0.0,7,I think this is fair because the manager does monitor the algorithm. If the manager did not monitor than I would think this would not be very fair.  But it seems like the manager has set the algorithm to be fair. ,5,4,6,1,2,2,"I don't think Chris will be necessarily angry, disappointed, or frustrated because the manager is in control of the evaluation. On the other hand I don't think he will be happy or joyful either. I do think he will feel proud if does well on the evaluation. ",6,I trust this decision because their is a person that sets the perimeters of the evaluation and this seems like a good idea. ,1,37,1,2,1,Algorithms are computer software that matches a set of instructions with answers. In this scenario the algorithm followed its code to evaluate the employees by rating them with the set of rules the software was given. 
2.1666666666666665,R_2VqNDgrf1SMK3AR,4,2,3,The algorithm categorizes customer tone and feedback to help make a decision on reviewing employee performance. The manager uses the information to make that decision.  ,1.0,0.0,4,I don't think I know enough about the algorithm to know if it's performance has been fair. ,2,2,2,6,5,6,Chris probably feels like he's been doing a good job. ,2,I don't think I know enough about the algorithm to know if it's performance has been fair. ,1,35,1,3,7,A way computers/machines calculate a set of information based on patterns and guides programmed.
