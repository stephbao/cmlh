4.0,R_eVbX2rGtEPa6MkF,4,2,3,"The algorithm evaluates our guy, and the manager basically just relays that information to him. ",1.0,0.0,4,I don't know how well it works; it's hard to make a judgment.,2,2,2,2,2,2,I think it would be hard to feel anything after being graded by a machine,2,I don't have any reason to believe this thing works at all. ,2,27,2,6,1,Algorithms are basically sets of rules that a computer follows. 
3.0,R_8xkJ58Kl4NT55Dz,4,3,3,The human manager chose to have the algorithim monitor the competency of his employees. ,0.0,0.0,5,The alga rhythm is designed to monitor performance so it would do a great job at doing such task.,3,3,3,5,5,5,He might feel like he is being watched at all times and feel under pressure to over perform his duties.,6,They are designed to highly monitor certain aspects of your performance to judge how well you are doing.,1,28,2,2,1,They use a wide database of different information relating to the task they are assigned to perform. they use that information to pair your demographics and interests with similar ones. They can also use this to judge voice stress levels and see if a worker is doing a good performance by studying his log of calls and seeing how many callers were becoming upset and if it was his fault or not.
3.1666666666666665,R_2rvztoSEEWVGM6r,4,4,2,The human manager would evaluate Chris based on the analyses data obtained from the algorithm.,1.0,0.0,3,"The algorithm can be used, but Chris also needs to be evalualted by an actual human being to make it more fair.",4,3,3,4,5,6,Chris would feel frustrated and disappointed in his evaluation because the algorithm is not perfect.,4,"I trust that the algorithm makes some good analyses, but not all the time. It can be used to supplement an evaluation after a manager has evaulated him already.",2,30,2,5,1,The algorithms are data or information obtained which looks for a certain patter in the way things are done.
2.5,R_yUtq5FZXsUEZCDL,4,3,3,"The human manager set up and monitored and adjusted the algorithm, depending upon what he wanted it to evaluate. The algorithm's job was to grade and evaluate the employee on whatever factors the manager wanted and it made it's decision on those factors and those factors only.",0.0,0.0,5,The manager monitors and adjusts how the algorithm considers different aspects so the manager has a direct hand in setting up what he wants from the employee and the algorithm strictly grades on that criteria.,3,2,2,6,5,5,"Chris will probably feel like the algorithm can't judge him as well as a human can because it can't read emotions, it's just programmed to look for certain things and it can't adjust.",5,The algorithm is set up by the manager so I feel like it will be looking for and grading on what the manager wants to see from the employees. I believe in some ways that the algorithm will be much less biased towards people than the manager could be.,2,33,2,5,1,An algorithm is a set of rules that are followed by a computer in order to accomplish some type of task.

4.0,R_ePVU5RDvxdc3q4F,4,2,3,The manager needed to evaluate Chris's performance as a customer service phone rep. and to do this it was required to use an algorithm.I had to decide how chris would feel and my opinion on the matter and the manager,1.0,0.0,6,"It might seem his privacy is being invaded but that is what bosses are for..making sure you are doing your job and evaluating you.In this situation,unless his boss listens in on his phone conversations this is the only was to evaluate his performance.",4,4,4,4,4,4,"I'm not Chris and his opinion about this matter may be different.If he disagrees he would definitely feel..angry,frustrated,disappointed",5,I hope any manager would make a good quality employee evaluation.You are suppose to be able to trust your employeer,1,41,1,2,1,process of rules to be followed over a technology device.Used to evaluate problems
5.833333333333333,R_6AtVa8gT9SWAJcR,4,4,3,The manager analyzes the employee's messages while the algorithm analyzes their tone. The algorithm makes the final decision for the evaluation while taking into account the manager's evaluation.,1.0,0.0,5,"The more criteria for evaluation, the more accurate it will be.",6,5,5,1,2,2,"Half of the evaluation is still done by a person, so he shouldn't be upset.",5,"There is human input, so it's trustworthy.",3,23,2,5,1,Steps taken to solve a problem

3.1666666666666665,R_3KPZXqdRBynYkrY,4,3,3,the manager is going to be evaluate by the algorithm,0.0,0.0,5,is a random algorithm,3,4,3,5,5,5,i think he would expect that someone evaluate him,5,there are some subjective aspects that an algorythm cant know,1,25,1,5,1,a random operation that calculate a function
5.0,R_0v1kJyS6e7SkR4B,4,4,3,They both have equal input in the analysis stage. The manager has the role of making a final decision.,1.0,0.0,6,"The algorithm allows for a non-biased evaluation to be done. On the other hand, having the manager's input adds the personal touch as well. There are some things that an algorithm just can't evaluate.",5,5,5,3,3,3,"I don't think Chris would feel any strong emotions, based on the given information.",5,"Since it is solely performance-based and non-biased, it is moderately trustworthy. It is not perfect though.",1,26,1,4,1,Algorithms are formulas designed to assess or evaluate given a set of predetermined parameters.
4.0,R_3nJbG0l48To5GjG,4,3,2,all i remember is the algorithm is the one who evaluated the recorded call.,1.0,0.0,5,because it will be fair across the board for all employees and there will be no favoritism shown by a manager bc it is done by algorithm,4,4,4,4,4,4,i dont know how he would feel. i assume he would feel good or bad based on his score,5,"if it is something a company implements, i assume it has been tested and approved ",1,28,1,3,1,a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations by a computer.
