Is it looking for certain keywords (ex: skills Chris possesses vs. the ones needed for the job) or things like GPA above a certain number? While this is fair to an extent, I think it could be also unfair if there are certain qualities a candidate possesses that the algorithm doesn't pick up as ""good"" but would be valued by the manager, but since he selects candidates via algorithm he wouldn't be able to know and a great candidate could be thrown out. ",4,4,4,5,5,6,"I think Chris could be offended by the fact that the manager didn't take the time to read his resume or personal statement (which he may have taken a lot of time on), but instead just used an algorithm to determine his eligibility for the position.

This is based on the assumption that Chris's performance be rated purely on performance. I would say it would be more fair if the manager uses the algorithm's results to influence his rating on Chris, but not depend entirely on it. This is because the manager may have a more empathetic understanding of Chris's circumstances. Also, customers can be quite biased, since they may tend to call for customer complaints rather than for positive reasons. It may be useful to look into studies that analyse the reliability of decision making ",4,4,4,6,6,6,"I'm assuming that Chris wants to do well in his performance, so he would do whatever it takes to get the algorithm to give him a positive evaluation. This may lead him to find strategies to ""cheat the system"", since he's competing against a machine that's attempting to be unbiased in decision making. If Chris tends to get pretty bad customer complaints or is insecure in his performance, he may view the algorithm with skepticism. Unless Chris has had a past history of positive customer experiences or is confident in his performance, I don't think he would view the algorithm positively.
